# Deslizator
Deslizator, a simple game similar to tetris, but only with straight blocks.

It's fully coded in Python and is played in the console.
It's played like tetris, you need to join the blocks with the same symbols to win points and continue to play.
The game finishes once the board is full of blocks.

It needs a txt document to play and it can be filled with A's, a's, b's and B's.
The game unifies the equal letters (A's with a's, b's with B's).

For now, it doesn't have any levels or difficulties, it will be added in the future.
